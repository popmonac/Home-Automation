This project demonstrates how to build a smart home automation system using Blynk and ESP32. With this setup, users can remotely control various electrical appliances, lights, and devices from their smartphones. The project utilizes Blynk, an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, to create a user-friendly interface for controlling the home automation system. The ESP32 microcontroller board acts as the brain of the system, handling the communication between Blynk and the connected devices. The code provided in this repository explains the setup, configuration, and implementation of the home automation system, making it easier for DIY enthusiasts to build their own smart homes. Explore the possibilities of the Internet of Things and take control of your devices with this versatile and accessible home automation project.

Features:

	Remotely control electrical appliances and devices from anywhere using the Blynk app.
	Simple and intuitive user interface for easy device management.
	Flexible and expandable design, supporting up to four relays for controlling multiple devices.
	LCD display for real-time status updates and system information.
	Customizable and adaptable for various home automation scenarios.
Hardware Requirements:

	ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32 DevKit, NodeMCU-32S, etc.)
	SIM800 GSM module (for Internet connectivity)
	4-channel relay module (or any suitable number of relays)
	16x2 or 20x4 character LCD display (optional)
	Breadboard and jumper wires for prototyping
	Power supply (battery coupled with charge regulator)
Software Requirements:

	Arduino IDE for coding and uploading the sketch to ESP32
	Blynk app (Android/iOS) for controlling and monitoring the devices remotely
	TinyGsmClient, BlynkSimpleTinyGSM, and LiquidCrystal libraries (can be installed via Arduino IDE Library Manager)
Instructions:

1.	Connect the components as per the circuit diagram using the Proteus simulation software.
2.	Install the required libraries via Arduino IDE Library Manager.
3.	Copy and upload the provided Arduino sketch (code) to the ESP32 board.
4.	Create a Blynk account and obtain the Blynk template ID, name, and authorization token.
5.	Customize the Blynk app interface by adding four buttons (one for each relay) with corresponding virtual pin numbers.
6.	Link the Blynk app buttons to the virtual pins defined in the Arduino sketch to control the relays.
7.	Power up the system and connect the ESP32 to Blynk using the GSM module for Internet connectivity.
Enjoy the convenience of managing your home appliances and devices remotely through the Blynk app!
